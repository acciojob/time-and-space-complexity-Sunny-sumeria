  <h1>Time Space and Complexity</h1>
  <p>Time complexity is a way to measure how long an algorithm takes to run as the input size grows, and it helps us compare different approaches objectively. By analyzing Time complexity, we can decide whether a solution will remain efficient for large inputs or slow down unacceptably, which is crucial in real-world applications where performance and scalability matter.</p>
  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> describes how much extra memory an algorithm needs as the input size increases. For example, an algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input size, which is common when we store elements in arrays, lists, or recursion stacks.</p>
